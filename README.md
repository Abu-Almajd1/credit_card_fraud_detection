# ðŸš¨ Real-Time Credit Card Fraud Detection ETL Pipeline

A robust real-time ETL pipeline to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using **Apache Kafka**, **Apache Spark**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Power BI**. Designed to ingest and process thousands of records per minute, this project enables real-time fraud flagging and dashboard analytics.

## ðŸ”Ž Project Description

This project simulates a high-volume **credit card transaction system** that detects anomalies using a pre-trained machine learning model and real-time streaming tools.

### âœ¨ Key Highlights:

- Processes **5,000+ transactions per minute**
- Real-time data ingestion via **Apache Kafka**
- Streaming ETL processing using **Apache Spark Structured Streaming**
- Anomaly detection using a pre-trained **SVM classifier**
- Data orchestration with **Apache Airflow**
- Reporting and monitoring with **Power BI**
